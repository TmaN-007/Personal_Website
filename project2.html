                            <div class="project-content">
                                <p>This project began with a simple but important question: how can technology make everyday life safer and more independent for people with visual impairments? The motivation was deeply personal because I wanted to take my engineering skills and apply them to something that goes beyond technical achievement, something that addresses a real human challenge. Visual impairments affect millions of people worldwide, and navigating spaces without reliable assistance can be stressful, limiting, and even dangerous. I felt compelled to explore whether accessible, low-cost technology could contribute to a practical solution.</p>

                                <p>I started with the idea of wearable glasses that could detect objects in the user's path and provide audio feedback in real time. The hardware foundation was built on an Arduino Nano ESP32, chosen for its balance of processing power and compact design. To enable object detection, I integrated ultrasonic sensors and a mini camera. The sensors provided distance measurements, while the camera fed data into a Python program using the YOLO algorithm, which is a highly efficient model for real-time object detection. This combination allowed the glasses to detect both the type of object and its proximity, which is critical for helping a user determine whether something is an immediate obstacle or just part of the environment.</p>

                                <p>Once detection was possible, the next step was feedback. I wanted the device to feel natural and responsive, so I integrated an audio output system that would verbally communicate the type of object and its distance. The goal was to give the user enough information to navigate confidently without overwhelming them with unnecessary detail. For example, if the glasses detected a chair two feet away, the system would provide a short spoken prompt indicating its presence and distance.</p>

                                <p>I designed the system with accessibility in mind, keeping the prototype lightweight and low cost. Affordability was important because assistive technologies often come with a price tag that makes them inaccessible to those who need them most. By focusing on inexpensive components and efficient design, I was able to create a functional prototype that demonstrated the potential of wearable vision-assist technology without putting cost out of reach.</p>

                                <p>What I took away from this project was more than technical knowledge. It reinforced the importance of empathy in engineering. Every design choice, from the type of sensors to the simplicity of the audio output, was guided by the thought of how a real person would experience the product. I learned that innovation is not just about building complex systems but about creating solutions that integrate seamlessly into someone's daily life. This project pushed me to think beyond circuits and code, to imagine the impact on a person navigating a busy street or walking confidently through their home. It also strengthened my desire to pursue work that sits at the intersection of technology and human experience, where every innovation contributes not just to efficiency or performance, but to dignity and independence.</p>
