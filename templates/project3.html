                    <div class="project-content">
                        <p>The Pantry Mobility Project was driven by a very different kind of challenge but one that was just as impactful. Food pantries play an essential role in serving communities, especially in areas where food insecurity is widespread, but they often face logistical and operational barriers that reduce their efficiency. The motivation behind this project was to explore how engineering systems thinking could be applied to a real social problem. I wanted to contribute to a project where technology and design could directly improve community wellbeing, while also learning how to collaborate with professionals from diverse backgrounds in business, design, and social services.</p>

                        <p>The project was sponsored by the Toyota Mobility Foundation and IEAM, and it required our team to work closely with multiple pantries across Marion County. Each pantry had unique needs and challenges, which meant that a one-size-fits-all solution would not be effective. Our task was to analyze their operations, design tailored interventions, and create models that future teams could build upon. I took a leading role in coordinating with stakeholders, gathering requirements, and translating them into technical and operational models using Cameo systems modeling software.</p>

                        <p>At God's Bounty Pantry, one of the major issues was transportation inefficiency. Trucks were being underutilized, and the cost of logistics was putting pressure on the pantry's budget. I facilitated coordination between God's Bounty and Shepard Community Pantry to share a larger truck for joint food runs. This solution increased food distribution capacity while lowering costs. Additionally, I successfully negotiated a contract with 913 Sports to use their transport trucks, which expanded logistics capabilities without requiring new infrastructure.</p>

                        <p>At Old Bethel and its partner pantries, the challenge was less about transportation and more about improving the onboarding process for new shoppers. I collaborated with local churches to create instructional videos that guided new shoppers through registration and pantry operations. This streamlined the onboarding process, reduced confusion, and allowed volunteers to focus more on service rather than repetitive explanations. Another innovation was integrating 24/7 live translation services in Haitian Creole through LTC Language Solutions. This greatly improved accessibility for the local Haitian community, ensuring they could receive services without language becoming a barrier.</p>

                        <p>One of my most significant contributions was developing comprehensive Cameo models for each pantry. These models documented existing workflows, highlighted bottlenecks, and simulated potential changes. They became a crucial resource for future teams, providing continuity and preventing the need to start analysis from scratch each year.</p>

                        <p>This project taught me how to balance technical efficiency with human-centered design. Every proposed solution needed to improve operations without disrupting the sensitive nature of food distribution and the dignity of the people being served. It was a chance to see firsthand how engineering principles, when combined with empathy and community collaboration, can lead to sustainable and meaningful change. The project left me with not only technical skills in systems modeling and process optimization but also a deeper understanding of how engineers can serve society in practical, compassionate ways.</p>
